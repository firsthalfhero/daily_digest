# Story 4.3: Email Delivery System

**Status:** Not Started

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable email delivery system, so that digests are delivered consistently at the scheduled time.

## Technical Context
- Dependencies: Story 1.2, 4.2
- Required Components: Email Service Integration, Delivery Scheduler, Monitoring, Retry Logic, Logging, Error Handling
- Testing Requirements: Delivery Reliability, Scheduling, Monitoring, Retry Scenarios, Logging, Error Handling

## Detailed Requirements

### Email Service Integration
- Integrate with chosen email service (e.g., SMTP, SendGrid)
- Support authentication and secure connections
- Handle email formatting and attachments
- Support batch and individual email sending

### Delivery Scheduling
- Implement scheduling for 6:30 AM Sydney time
- Support configurable delivery times
- Ensure time zone accuracy
- Allow for manual and automated triggers

### Delivery Monitoring
- Track delivery status and outcomes
- Monitor for delivery failures and delays
- Provide real-time and historical delivery metrics
- Integrate with alerting system

### Retry Logic
- Implement retry mechanism for failed deliveries
- Support exponential backoff and max retry limits
- Log all retry attempts and outcomes
- Allow for manual retry triggers

### Delivery Logging
- Log all delivery attempts, successes, and failures
- Store logs for auditing and troubleshooting
- Support log export and analysis

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handle delivery errors and exceptions
- Provide clear error messages and codes
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting
- Ensure system resilience to transient failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Delivery failures are minimized
- [ ] Delivery status is tracked for each email
- [ ] Batch and individual deliveries are supported

### AC2: Scheduling Works Correctly
- [ ] Emails are sent at the correct scheduled time
- [ ] Time zone handling is accurate
- [ ] Manual and automated triggers work
- [ ] Scheduling is configurable

### AC3: Delivery is Monitored
- [ ] Delivery status and metrics are available
- [ ] Failures and delays are detected
- [ ] Monitoring integrates with alerting
- [ ] Historical data is accessible

### AC4: Retries Work Appropriately
- [ ] Failed deliveries are retried as per policy
- [ ] Exponential backoff is implemented
- [ ] Max retry limits are enforced
- [ ] Manual retries are possible

### AC5: Delivery is Logged
- [ ] All delivery attempts are logged
- [ ] Logs are accessible for troubleshooting
- [ ] Log export is supported
- [ ] Audit trails are maintained

### AC6: Errors are Handled Gracefully
- [ ] Errors are caught and reported
- [ ] System recovers from transient failures
- [ ] Clear error messages are provided
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are triggered on errors

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup and Integration
- [ ] Set up email service integration

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement retry logic
- [ ] Expand monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Add support for batch sending
- [ ] Refine scheduling and time zone handling
- [ ] Improve error handling and reporting

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Write delivery reliability tests
- [ ] Test scheduling accuracy
- [ ] Simulate delivery failures and retries
- [ ] Validate logging and monitoring
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### Phase 4: Documentation and Polish
- [ ] Write technical documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document best practices
- [ ] Create maintenance guide
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## Technical Notes
