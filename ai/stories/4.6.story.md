# Story 4.6: Integration Testing

**Status:** Review

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration testing, so that I can ensure all components work together reliably.

## Technical Context
- Dependencies: All previous stories
- Required Components: End-to-End Test Suite, Integration Test Suite, Test Data, Test Scenarios, Performance Testing, Chaos Testing
- Testing Requirements: End-to-End Coverage, Integration Flows, Test Data Completeness, Scenario Realism, Performance, Failure Handling

## Detailed Requirements

### End-to-End Tests
- Create tests covering the full user journey
- Simulate real-world usage scenarios
- Validate integration of all major components
- Ensure data flows correctly between systems

### Integration Test Suite
- Implement tests for all component interactions
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure compatibility between modules
- Automate integration test execution

### Test Data
- Create comprehensive and realistic test data
- Support multiple user profiles and scenarios
- Handle edge cases and incomplete data
- Maintain test data versioning

### Test Scenarios
- Develop realistic and challenging test scenarios
- Cover normal, edge, and failure cases
- Simulate external service failures and delays
- Document all scenarios and expected outcomes

### Performance Testing
- Measure system performance under load
- Identify bottlenecks and scalability issues
- Validate performance against requirements
- Automate performance test execution

### Chaos Testing
- Introduce controlled failures and disruptions
- Validate system resilience and recovery
- Document chaos test results and lessons learned
