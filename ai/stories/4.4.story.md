# Story 4.4: Scheduling System

**Status:** Review

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust scheduling system, so that digests are generated and delivered at exactly 6:30 AM Sydney time.

## Technical Context
- Dependencies: Story 1.2, 4.3
- Required Components: Scheduler, Timezone Handler, Monitoring, Recovery Logic, Logging
- Testing Requirements: Scheduling Accuracy, Timezone Handling, Monitoring, Recovery, Logging, Schedule Testing

## Detailed Requirements

### Scheduling Logic
- Implement scheduling for 6:30 AM Sydney time
- Support configurable schedules
- Ensure accurate and reliable triggers
- Allow for manual and automated scheduling

### Timezone Handling
- Handle time zone conversions and daylight saving changes
- Support user-specific time zones if needed
- Ensure scheduling accuracy across regions

### Schedule Monitoring
- Monitor schedule execution and status
- Detect missed or delayed schedules
- Provide real-time and historical schedule metrics
- Integrate with alerting system

### Schedule Recovery
- Implement recovery for missed or failed schedules
- Support automatic and manual recovery
- Log recovery actions and outcomes

### Schedule Logging
- Log all schedule events, triggers, and outcomes
- Store logs for auditing and troubleshooting
- Support log export and analysis

### Schedule Testing
- Test scheduling accuracy and reliability
- Simulate time zone changes and edge cases
- Validate monitoring and recovery logic
